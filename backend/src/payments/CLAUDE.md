# payments

## Purpose
Integrates with Bank of Georgia's (BOG) e-commerce API to let a buyer top up their WaveCoin balance
with real money. This is the *only* real-money entry point into WaveHub (see root `CLAUDE.md`
architecture notes — WaveCoin top-up, not per-order fiat escrow, is the chosen payment model).

## Key files
- `bog-payments.controller.ts` — `POST /payments/bog/create-order` (guarded, requires a session) and
  `POST /payments/bog/callback` (public — BOG calls this, verified by signature instead of auth)
- `bog-payments.service.ts` — talks to BOG's API: OAuth2 client-credentials token, order creation,
  and `getOrderDetails` (authoritative status lookup, used by the callback handler)
- `bog-signature.util.ts` — `verifyBogCallbackSignature`, RSA-SHA256 verification of the
  `Callback-Signature` header against BOG's published public key (embedded as
  `BOG_DEFAULT_CALLBACK_PUBLIC_KEY`, overridable via `BOG_CALLBACK_PUBLIC_KEY` env var)
- `bog-topup-intent.entity.ts` — `BogTopupIntent`: created when checkout starts, keyed by the
  transactionId we generate (= BOG's `external_order_id`), so the callback can map back to a
  user + WaveCoin amount
- `payments.module.ts` — wires the above; imports `UsersModule`, `WalletModule`, `AuthModule`

## Data model
Owns `bog_topup_intents` (migration: `CreateWalletLedger`, same migration as the wallet ledger
tables since they landed together). Calls into `backend/src/wallet/` (`WalletService.recordTopup`)
to actually credit a balance — this module never touches `users.wavecoinBalance` itself.

## Conventions & gotchas
- **`create-order` derives the WaveCoin amount server-side at a fixed 1:1 rate from `amountGel`** —
  the client only sends `amountGel`, `successUrl`, `failUrl`. Earlier code accepted a client-supplied
  `wavecoins` field independent of `amountGel`, which meant a client could request being credited an
  arbitrary WaveCoin amount for whatever it actually paid. Do not reintroduce a client-supplied
  WaveCoin count.
- **`create-order` uses the authenticated user (`@CurrentUserId()`), not a client-supplied
  `username`.** Same class of bug as above — trusting the body for "which account gets credited" on
  a financial endpoint is a direct account-takeover-adjacent vector. Always derive identity from the
  session.
- **The callback handler does not trust the callback body's own status field.** It verifies the
  signature (proving BOG sent *something* for this `order_id`), then calls
  `BogPaymentsService.getOrderDetails(bogOrderId)` to re-fetch the authoritative current status from
  BOG's API before crediting anything. This is deliberate — treat the callback as a notification to
  go check the source of truth, not as itself trustworthy for money decisions, even though it's
  signed. If you're tempted to read `order_status` directly off the callback body to save a round
  trip, don't.
- **Signature verification needs the raw request bytes**, not a re-serialized copy of the parsed
  body (JSON re-serialization can differ in key order/whitespace and silently break RSA
  verification). This is why `main.ts` passes `{ rawBody: true }` to `NestFactory.create` — the
  controller reads `req.rawBody`, not `JSON.stringify(req.body)`.
- **`recordTopup` is idempotent**, so the callback handler doesn't need its own dedup logic beyond
  checking `intent.status !== 'completed'` before calling it — a duplicate BOG callback retry is
  safe either way.
- **The callback endpoint always returns `{ ok: true }` / HTTP 200**, even for invalid signatures,
  unknown orders, or lookup failures — this is deliberate so BOG doesn't retry indefinitely against
  something we've already permanently rejected. Errors are logged server-side (`Logger.warn`/`.error`),
  not surfaced to the caller. Don't change this to return 4xx/5xx for "expected" rejection cases;
  reserve non-200 for genuine infrastructure failures if you add retryable ones later.
- The BOG public key and API endpoints referenced here were fetched from
  `https://api.bog.ge/docs/en/payments/` on 2026-07-15. If BOG's docs have changed since, re-verify
  before trusting this module against production traffic — don't assume it's still current forever.

## Related modules
- `backend/src/wallet/` — the callback's only effect on state goes through
  `WalletService.recordTopup`.
- `backend/src/auth/` — `AuthGuard`/`@CurrentUserId()` gate `create-order`.
- `backend/src/users/` — looks up the user for their username (used in the BOG order description)
  and id.

## Status
Both endpoints are implemented and unit-tested at the signature-verification layer
(`bog-signature.util.spec.ts`). Not verified against BOG's real sandbox/production API — no live BOG
credentials or a reachable public callback URL were available in the environment this was built in
(BOG can only call back to a publicly reachable HTTPS URL; `BACKEND_PUBLIC_URL=localhost` won't
receive anything without a tunnel). Before relying on this in production: get real BOG sandbox
credentials, confirm the callback body's actual full shape against a real test payment (the fields
used here — `body.order_id`, and `order_status.key`/`external_order_id` from the receipt endpoint —
are drawn from BOG's public docs, not observed from a real payload), and confirm the public key is
still current.
